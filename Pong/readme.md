Build the program using javac followed by all .java files in /src.
You can also use the Makefile provided and use "make pong" or use the /src files  with an IDE such as Eclipse.
Note that the packages have to be preserved as they are.
You can test the code if you have JUnit with "make tests" or eclipse's built-in JUnit.

The program is run with the commando "java -cp ./src/ controller.Pong" while standing in the Project directory.

The goals completed with this excercise:
