Build the program using javac followed by all .java files in /src.
You can also use the Makefile provided and use "make MUD" or use the /src files and /doc files with an IDE such as Eclipse.
You can test the code if you have JUnit with "make tests" or eclipse's built-in JUnit.

The program is run with the commando java "./bin/Main.class" or "java -jar ./bin/MUD.jar".
